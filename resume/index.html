      <p>I AM A STRIVING WEB DEVELOPER, TECHNOLOGY ENTHUSIAST, HUSBAND, NATURE LOVER, AND AVID GAMER. I USED TO MANAGE LIVE, LARGE SCALE AUDIO, LIGHTING, AND STAGE PRODUCTION, BUT NOW I MAKE WEB APPS. THE BLEND OF PROBLEM SOLVING AND CREATIVITY REQUIRED TO BUILD ANY NEW APPLICATION IS GREATLY CHALLENGING AND REWARDING. I ENJOY BOTH FRONT END AND BACK END DESIGN AS EACH BRING THEIR OWN UNIQUE HURDLES AND OPPORTUNITIES.</p>

        <p>Technology has always been my passion, and it is my firm belief that its purpose is to enhance our lives in the modern age. I started volunteering with my churchâ€™s tech team when I was 12 years old, learning little by little about using audio and video equipment. I immediately loved having the ability to be creative using technology. In college, I studied business management, but after a few years, decided that I would like to pursue web and application development. I attended Coding Dojo in Seattle where I was able to solidify my coding foundation with over 700 additional hours of experience. For 2 years, I've was a part of a team at Praxent, where we met our client's needs by building large scale, intuitive web apps. I currently develop and maintain a large Ember.js application at Impact DataSource. I will always enjoy learning new technologies, languages, and frameworks and look forward to continuing to advance my skill set in the future.</p>
